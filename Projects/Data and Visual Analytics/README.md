Our choropleth tool allows users to explore loan default history by the following attributes:
* Vintage: Year of loan origination.
* Year: Year of default.
* FICO: A number, prepared by third parties, summarizing the borrower’s creditworthiness, which may be indicative of the likelihood that the borrower will timely repay future obligations.
* LTV: A ratio obtained by dividing the original mortgage loan amount on the note date by the lesser of the mortgaged property’s appraised value on the note date or its purchase price.
