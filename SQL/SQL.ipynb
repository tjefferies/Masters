    "### History\n",
    "\n",
    "* Originally known as Structured English QUEry Language (SEQUEL)\n",
    "    * Part of SYSTEM R, 1973\n",
    "* Now known as SQL\n",
    "    * Based on relational tuple calculus and some algebra\n",
    "* ANSI & ISO Standards over the years\n",
    "* Supported by almost all commercial RDMBS\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insert, Delete, and Update\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Insert\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**UserInterests**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Email | Interest | SinceAge\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| user1@gatech.edu | Swimming | 7 |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To insert new rows into the  relation, we use the `INSERT` statement like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "`INSERT INTO UserInterests (Email, Interest, SinceAge)\n",
    "VALUES ('user12@gt.edu', 'Reading', 5)`\n",
    "\n",
    "After the `INSERT` statement above...\n",
    "\n",
    "**UserInterests**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Email | Interest | SinceAge\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| user1@gatech.edu | Swimming | 7 |\n",
    "| user2@gatech.edu | Reading | 5 |\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, the syntax for `INSERT` is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`INSERT INTO table (col_1, col_2, col_n)\n",
    "VALUES (val_1, val_2, val_n)`\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, `INSERT` only processes a single row at a time.<br>\n",
    "Unless, we specify that the `INSERT` statement use values from a `SELECT` subquery.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Delete\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's say we want to delete certain rows from the **UserInterests** relation - we use the `DELETE` keyword for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`DELETE FROM UserInterests\n",
    "WHERE Interest = 'Swimming'`\n",
    "\n",
    "After execution, our **UserInterests** relation will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "**UserInterests**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Email | Interest | SinceAge\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| user2@gatech.edu | Reading | 5 |\n",
    "\n",
    "General form of `DELETE` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "`DELETE FROM table\n",
    "WHERE col_n = val`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the `UPDATE` keyword to change existing values in a given relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "`UPDATE UserInterests\n",
    "SET Interest = 'Music'\n",
    "WHERE Email = 'user2@gatech.edu'`\n",
    "\n",
    "After the statement executes, the **UserInterests** relation will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Email | Interest | SinceAge\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| user2@gatech.edu | Music | 5 |\n",
    "\n",
    "General form:\n",
    "\n",
    "`UPDATE table\n",
    "SET col_n = val\n",
    "WHERE col_m = val_m`\n",
    "\n",
    "### General SQL Query Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all SQL queries follow the same general syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT col_1, col_2, col_n\n",
    "FROM table_1, table_2, table_m\n",
    "WHERE condition`\n",
    "\n",
    "* column$_{\\,n}$ is the name of a **column**, like BirthYear\n",
    "* table$_{\\,m}$ is the name of a **table**, like RegularUser\n",
    "* **condition** may compare values of columns to constants or to each other.\n",
    "    * BirthYear > 1985\n",
    "    * CurrentCity = HomeTown\n",
    "* conditions can be combined with **AND**, **OR**, **NOT** and **()**\n",
    "\n",
    "In relational algebra, our general syntax becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\pi_{\\text{column}_{1}, \\ldots, {\\text{column}_{n}}}\\left(\\sigma_{\\text{condition}}\\left(\\text{table}_{1}\\times \\ldots \\times \\text{table}_{m}\\right)\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "* all sql queries must have `SELECT` and `FROM` clauses.\n",
    "* the sql query is equivalent to the relational algebra query (with some exceptions).\n",
    "* if there is no `WHERE` clause, the query defaults to a Cartesian product followed by the specified projection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inner Join and Dot Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "\n",
    "**RegularUser**\n",
    "\n",

    "FROM RegularUser, YearSalary\n",
    "WHERE RegularUser.BirthYear = YearSalary.BirthYear`\n",

    "| user3@gatech.edu | 1967 | 45000 |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we must use dot notation (table_m.col_n) to distinguish which relation to pull the `BirthYear` column from. This is required to resolve ambiguitity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Natural Join\n",
    "\n",
    "We get the exact same result set as above using a natural join statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT Email, RegularUser.BirthYear, Salary\n",
    "FROM RegularUser NATURAL JOIN YearSalary`\n",

    "| user2@gatech.edu | 1969 | 43000 |\n",
    "| user3@gatech.edu | 1967 | 45000 |\n",
    "\n",
    "A `NATURAL JOIN` statement joins two relations on the columns that have the same names.\n",
    "\n",
    "We still must use dot notation (table_m.col_n) to distinguish which relation to pull the `BirthYear` column from. This is required to resolve ambiguitity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case where there are no columns that have the same names, the `NATURAL JOIN` statement defaults to the Cartesian Product. A `NATURAL JOIN` statement never returns duplicate column names!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aliases\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write the same query as above using aliases instead of the whole table name:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT Email, R.BirthYear, Salary\n",
    "FROM RegularUser AS R, YearSalary Y\n",
    "WHERE R.BirthYear = Y.BirthYear`\n",

    "`R` and `Y` are tuple variables.<br>\n",
    "* Tuple variables aka aliases save typing\n",
    "* Used to disambiguate table references\n",
    "* Aliases MUST be used when joining a table to itself\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Left Outer Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "To include results from one \"left\" of the relations without a resulting match in the second \"right\" relation, we can use a left join:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT Email, RegularUser.BirthYear, Salary\n",
    "FROM RegularUser LEFT OUTER JOIN YearSalary`\n",
    "\n",
    "Result:\n",

    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",

    "| user8@gatech.edu | 1968 | NULL |\n",
    "| user9@gatech.edu | 1988 | NULL |\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that since users 4,6,8, and 9 do not have a corresponding `YearSalary.BirthYear` record, their values for `Salary` have been filled with NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### String Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is a practical tool that needs certain capabilities outside the scope of relational algebra and relational calculus - string matching and the `DISTINCT` keywords being perfect examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say our objective is to *find data about RegularUsers who live in a CurrentCity that starts with \"San\"*. We can use the string matching capability that is native to base SQL:\n",
