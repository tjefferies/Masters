    "When designing a relationship that has a mandatory / disjoint requirement specified in the EER, we cheat and only model the subtypes `ET1` and `ET2`. A tuple triplet $\\left(A, B, C|D\\right)$ is used to maintain uniqueness for a given record in either the `ET1` or `ET2` tables.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "We have two options for mapping a Mandatory / Overlap relationship to a relational model.\n",

    "Option 1:\n",

    "\n",
    "Again, we have two options for mapping a Non-mandatory / Overlap relationship to a relational model.\n",
    "* Leo advises against option 1 because now we can actually have null values in both `C` and `D` - managing the cases for `type` becomes more difficult\n",

    "Let's walk through the steps above, given the ER diagram below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](FundamentalsOfDatabaseSystemsChapter9ERDiagram.svg)\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step1: Mapping of regular entity types\n",
    "\n",
    "`EMPLOYEE`, `DEPARTMENT`, and `PROJECT` become relations or tables when mapped to the relational model.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "![](FundamentalsOfDatabaseSystemsChapter9ERDiagram-Step 1 Map Regular Entities.svg)\n",
    "___\n",
    "##### Step 2: Mapping of weak entity types\n",
    "\n",
    "For each weak entity type $W$ in the ER schema with owner entity type $E$, create a relation $R$ and include all simple attributes (or children of composite attributes) of $W$ as attributes of $R$. In addition, include as foreign key attributes of $R$, the primary key attribute(s) of the relation(s) that correspond to the owner entity type(s): this takes care of mapping the identifying relationship type of $W$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](FundamentalsOfDatabaseSystemsChapter9ERDiagram-Step 2 Map Weak Entities.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically we elect to use the propogate `CASCADE` option for the referential triggered action on the foreign key in the relation corresponding to the weak entity type, since a weak entity has an existence dependency on it's owner entity.\n",
    "* Can be used for both actions\n",
    "    * ON UPDATE\n",
    "    * ON DELETE\n",
    "    \n",
    "___\n",
    "##### Step3: Mapping of binary 1:1 relationship types\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the easiest case of 1:1 relationships with one side having mandatory participation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](FundamentalsOfDatabaseSystemsChapter9ERDiagram-Step 3 Map Binary 1_1 Relationships.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each binary 1:1 relationship type $R$ in the ER schema, identify the relations $S$ and $T$ that correspond to the entity types participating in $R$. There are three possible approaches:\n",
    "1. Foreign key approach\n",
    "2. Merged relationship approach\n",
    "3. Cross-reference or relationship relation approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We almost always only end up using the foreign key approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign key approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose one of the relations - $S$, say - and include as a foreign key in $S$ the primary key of $T$. It is better to choose an entity type with *total participation* in $R$ in the role of $S$. Include all of the simple attributes (or children of composite attributes) of the 1:1 relationship type $R$ as attributes of $S$.\n",
    "___\n",
    "##### Step 4: Mapping of binary 1:N relationship types\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's map the WORKS_FOR, SUPERVISION, and CONTROLS relationships. There are two possible approaches:\n",
    "* The foreign key approach\n",
    "* The relationship relation approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Leo prefers the relationship relation approach (detailed above), so we will instead look at the foreign key approach.\n",
    "* The advantage of the relationship relation approach is we do not get NULL values in our database\n",
    "\n",
    "![](FundamentalsOfDatabaseSystemsChapter9ERDiagram-Step 4_ Map Binary 1_N Relationship Types.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The foreign key approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each regular binary 1:N relationship type $R$, identify the relation $S$ that represents the participating entity type at the $N$-*side* of the relationship type. Include as foreign key in $S$ the primary key of the relation $T$ that represents the other entity type participating in $R$.\n",
    "* We choose to do it this way because each entity instance on the N-side is related to at most one entity instance on the 1-side of the relationship type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, include any simple attributes (or children of composite attributes) of the 1:N relationship type as attributes of $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*** Recursive Relationships ***:\n",
    "\n",
    "A recursive relationship is when a relation has a 1:N relationship between attributes native to itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](FundamentalsOfDatabaseSystemsChapter9ERDiagram-Step 4_ Map Binary 1_N Relationship Types 2.svg)\n",
    "___\n",
    "##### Step 5: Mapping of binary M:N relationship types\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "![](FundamentalsOfDatabaseSystemsChapter9ERDiagram-Step 5_ Map Binary M_N Relationship Types.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the traditional relational model with no multivalued attributes, the only option for M:N relationships is the **relationship relation (cross-reference) option**. For each binary M:N relationship type $R$, create a new relation $S$ to represent $R$. Include as foreign key attributes in $S$ the primary keys of the relations that represent the participating entity types; their *combination* will form the *primary key* of $S$.\n",
    "* Include any attributes of the M:N relationship type (or children of composite attributes) as attributes of $S$.\n",

    "Use the propogate `CASCADE` option for the referential triggered action on the foreign key in the relationship relation (`WORKS_ON` in our case)\n",
    "* Use for both actions\n",
    "    * ON UPDATE\n",
    "    * ON DELETE\n",
    "___\n",
    "##### Step 6: Mapping of multivalued attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at mapping multivalued attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each multivalued attribute $A$, create a new relation $R$. This relation $R$ will include an attribute corresponding to $A$, plus the primary key attribute $K$ - as a foreign key in $R$- of the relation that represents the entity type or reltionship type that has $A$ as a multivalued attribute.\n",
    "* Primary key of $R$ is the tuple pair $\\left(A, K\\right)$\n",
    "* If the multivalued attribute is composite, we only include it's children\n",
    "\n",
    "![](FundamentalsOfDatabaseSystemsChapter9ERDiagram-Step 6_ Map Multivalued Attributes.svg)\n",

    "Use the propogate `CASCADE` option for the referential triggered action on the foreign key in the relationship relation (`DEPT_LOCATIONS.DNumber` in our case)\n",
    "* Use for both actions\n",
    "    * ON UPDATE\n",
    "    * ON DELETE\n",
    "    \n",
    "___\n",
    "##### Step 7: Mapping of N-ary Relationship Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Although not explicitly required for this example (because we don't have any $N$-ary relationships in ER diagram), we would use the **relationship relation** to map N-ary relationship types.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each $n$-ary relationship type $R$, where $n>2$, create a new relationship relation $S$ to represent $R$. Include as foreign key attributes in $S$ the primary keys of the relations that represent the participating entity types.\n",
    "* Include any simple attributes (or children of composite attributes) of the $N$-ary relationship type as attributes of $S$.\n",
    "* The primary key of $S$ is the combination or concatenation of all the foreign keys that reference the relations representing the participating entity types.\n",
    "    * If the cardinality constraints on any of the entity types $E$ participating in $R$ is 1, then the primary key of $S$ should not include the foreign key attribute that references the relation $E^{*}$ corresponding to $E$\n",

    "![](FundamentalsOfDatabaseSystemsChapter9ERDiagram-Step 7_ Map N-ary Relationship Types.svg)\n",
